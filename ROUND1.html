                <p>We, at PCCoE try to connect with as many companies as possible for placement of students. We enjoy the advantage of getting cream layer of students at our institutes. Our Alumni are also performing well in the industries where they are placed. Hence we could get the recognition from industries. We believe that the backbone of our T&P Cell is our student volunteers of T&P Cell who work very hard with full enthusiasm to conduct the recruitment drives smoothly. All these volunteers develop their management skills, interpersonal skills and above all Leadership skills. All such student volunteers become Managers/ Project leaders earlier in their career as compared to their other counterparts because of these skills. We would like to assure Industry, Students and Parents that we will not leave any stone unturned to make all our stakeholders Happy and Proud.</p>
